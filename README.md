# shuf.py
This is a python program that executes like the shuf command in the GNU CoreUtils Library. It shuffles its input by outputting a random permutation of its input lines where each output permutation is equally likely. It also involves the optional arguments --input-range (-i), --head-count (-n), --repeat (-r), and --help.
