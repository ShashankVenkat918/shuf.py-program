# shuf.py
This is a python program that executes like the shuf command in the GNU CoreUtils Library. It shuffles its input by outputting a random permutation of its input lines where each output permutation is equally likely. It also involves the optional arguments --input-range (-i), --head-count (-n), --repeat (-r), and --help. The program supports zero non-option arguments or a single non-option argument "-" (either of which means read from standard input), or a single non-option argument other than "-" (which specifies the input file name). "--input-range (-i)" will take the input as if it came from a file with the range of unsigned decimal integers [low-->high] as if they were on separate lines. "--repeat (-r)" will allow for repeats in the shuffled values. "--head-count (-n)" will constraint the output to atmost _count_ lines. "--help" provides info on the function.
